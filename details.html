        <h1>Aims</h1>
        <p class="info">This project (Petcare) is about helping humans monitor their pet behaviours and health conditions for understanding and curing purposes with the use of technology. The system will be provided to veterinary clinics and hospitals worldwide to increase pet life qualities.</p>
        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p class="info">Petcare seeks to be delivered to many veterinary clinics and hospitals worldwide. We are willing to create an emotional connection between humans (owners) and their house animals so as to produce more experience to animal lovers and for people who want to do research on them.</p>
        <p class="info">The most important is accuracy of collecting data and information such as: blood pressure, heart rates, temperature, body languages and their behaviours then detect their emotions based on the situations. Therefore, pet owners will understand and know if their pets are happy, sad, angry or scared. Furthermore, veterinarians can observe pet health and reduce the range of diseases diagnosed.</p>
        <p class="info">Software has a main part totally based on AI which will be programmed by a software team who will include our current team member: Dung, Khoi and Huy. all members have to be experts at some aspects such as: data science, machine learning, linear algebra, implement algorithms and etc. Moreover, computer vision on cameras recording animal behaviours at houses.</p>
        <p class="info">Production plays an important role in our project, there are wearable kit (bell and animal body monitoring device) and camera with computer vision. Those hardware are available technologies at the current. Manufacturing will be an essential part for the success of Petcare to produce the kit, camera and licenses for the technologies, then there must be a technician team who will work on all the setup process for customers such as wearing bells, and equip cameras.</p>
        <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>
        <p class="info">
            PetCare will be a subscription service for veterinary clinics that when purchased, a team of technicians will install the PetCare application onto the local computer system of the client, and help set up a &ldquo;diagnosis area&rdquo; equipped with at least 2 cameras placed directly across from one another (Front and back) and more purchasable when ordering the service, and a number of special PetCare mobile sensors. After installation, a technician is then to give all medical professionals in the facility a training course on how to use the application at a time most convenient for them whilst also establishing a hotline for support and customer service. What the application does is take a number of symptoms as input from preliminary diagnosis - either from the user manually inputting them or from what the 2 cameras were able to pick up: Physical anomalies like swelling, bleeding, open wounds like scratch and bite marks, bruising, etc; Emotional state like fear, pain, distress,... and return a list of likely illnesses and a percentage of how likely the animal is to have said illnesses. The application will achieve this with the inhouse AI hosted on our cloud. To help with the diagnosis, we will also equip clinics with a number of small sensors that can be strapped onto patients, capable of detecting heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV) using something called photoplethysmography (the same technology used in Apple watches to monitor heart beat) and these sensors will be made commercially available as well (not just for professionals ) to help pet owners monitor the basic health conditions of their pet (users must install our mobile PetCare app to activate the sensors)
            <br><br>
            To ensure the service&rsquo;s functional capacity, the team will be split into two divisions: Software and Hardware.
            <br><br>
            The first order of business for the Software team is the development and maintenance of the AI and user Application. The AI must be built using insight and consultancy from medical professionals, with a large enough database of symptoms and its correlating illnesses. This will likely be a massive undertaking for the team and the consultants, to create not just the AI but its database of inference from scratch using the medical expertise of professionals, but it is a challenge worth taking. The team will be a collection of AI engineers ,Data Analysts and Software developers with relevant experience and a medical professional consultant for the project that can help form good training parameters for our machine learning model. The application must be developed for both pc and the mobile platform, with ease-of-use the focus of development - medical professionals already have a lot on their plate so the app must be easy to learn and use (alleviate the potential for any added burdens like learning a complicated system). Since the AI will be hosted on a cloud, the client must already have an internet connection to make use of our services. A lost internet connection would unfortunately stop the application from functioning. The mobile version of the app is made for use with our PetCare sensors and thus will have to be free, activation of the app requires the user to scan a QR code on the surface of the sensor they have purchased from us. The mobile application will most likely be built and maintained by a separate team from the main application.
            <br><br>
            Our service will no doubt make use of cloud services like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services as the host environment for our AI. This is where the hardware team comes in, to work with our cloud service provider of choice and maintain operational efficiency, which will be the most cost-effective option as establishing a personal cloud ecosystem that's large enough for our operations would be extremely costly. Another role for the team will be to overlook the production and manufacturing of the sensors by acquiring deals with local manufacturing plants and vendors. There will be another team to handle the logistics (delivery of the product).
            <br><br>
            As PetCare is a <em>service</em> and not a <em>product</em> (the main application, not the sensors), we will also have to cover installation and activation for our clients. This means establishing and sustaining a team of technicians qualified enough to install, maintain, and give technical support whenever the need arises, they will have to work around the clock to make sure any client-side issues are resolved within a reasonable time and with no margin for error. This team of technicians will be part of the hardware team and will most likely also handle technical support for our commercial sensor.
            <br><br>
            Our project will most likely start with the PetCare sensors as our sole product as development of the AI is hard to estimate and may take a considerable amount of time. So we will try to gain as much capital as possible with the role out of the sensors.
            <br><br>
            Our project originally only had the PetCare application as the product and we were still unsure of which business model to go with. We had considered the fact that part of the application requires a camera to operate would not make PetCare a good product especially for the desktop platform (The most common platform in a medical environment) and since the application still requires medical expertise for the output to be worthwhile/effective, we came to the conclusion that a <strong><em>service</em></strong> would be more beneficial for our target demographic (Veterinary clinics) by removing any need for our clients to be technologically savvy (Installation and basic training is offered to clients) and also make PetCare more financially viable. We came up with the idea for the sensor when we were researching different ways you can retrieve important health metrics in animals (as input for the application) because cameras can only detect so much (obvious physical anomalies as stated above) and came across the <em>Stemoscope</em> (stemoscope.com) product. A special auditory sensor that can monitor the heart rate and respiratory rates for dogs and cats, which sparked our interest in creating our own type of pet monitor (for both commercial and clinical use). One of our team members (Dung) came up with the idea to use whatever technology Apple uses in Apple Watches to monitor human heart rate and other important metrics (blood pressure, heart rate variability, etc.). We found that what Apple uses is called Photoplethysmography (support.apple.com) and can be applied to dogs and cats just as well but the technology is currently limited to surgical uses (The PPG sensor is placed on the tongue whilst the animal is under anesthesia). Upon further research we learned that it was possible to use the PPG sensor on other parts of the dog or cat&rsquo;s body - for dogs it was the metacarpus and tail; for cats the digit is a sufficient alternative (Cugmas B, 2019). We then decided that creating these PPG sensors and miniaturizing them into watch-like devices that can be strapped onto a dog&rsquo;s tail or its metacarpus or a cat&rsquo;s digit would make a very helpful tool for vets and pet owners alike to detect the heart rate, blood pressure and HRV of their animals and would also become another way for the PetCare app to receive additional data to more precisely diagnose the possible afflictions of an animal.
            <br><br>
            The project may be ambitious, but the plethora of AIs that are made use of and implemented in the medical and healthcare fields (Daley S, 2019) prove that it is not impossible. Currently, our PetCare sensors are perhaps the easiest part of this project and can immediately be put into production if given enough funding. PPG sensors are very simple, cheap for purchase or can be designed in-house. The design of which is just a simple Green LED and a photodetector connected to each other in any sort of housing.&nbsp;
            <br><br>
            Creating the AI for the project will not be an easy task, it is not however, impossible. Things like <em>PathAI, BuoyHealth, Enlitic, Freenome </em>are only <strong><em>some</em></strong> of the plethora of AI systems currently being used to help doctors and patients all around the world to diagnose, treat and cure illnesses. <em>BuoyHealth</em> has achieved just what PetCare seeks to accomplish and in humans no less (not just dogs and cats), <em>&ldquo;an AI-based symptom and cure checker that uses algorithms to diagnose and treat illness.&rdquo;</em>. Essentially a chatbot that receives a patient&rsquo;s symptoms and health concerns and guides them on what to do based on its diagnosis. Just because these systems haven&rsquo;t been implemented world-wide <strong><em>does not</em></strong> mean they do not exist <strong><em>or</em></strong> that their accomplishments are unrealistic.

        <h1>Roles</h1>
        <p class="info">
            Project Manager or Lead Developer who is compulsory to have in any project team will manage the tracking progress, timely delivery, divide workload, set up for meetings and make plans for goals and achievements.&nbsp;
            <br><br>
            The Data Engineer position plays an important role in the team. There is nothing when we start, so we need people who collect data and analyze them. To make machines learn, we definitely need a huge amount of data automatically absorbed and sorted. This position does algorithms to collect all the data such as: blood pressure, heart rate and behaviours of animals through sensors and cameras having computer vision. They will have many patterns for emotions, health conditions or habits.
            <br><br>
            User Interface Designer is the person who works on the front-end application view that customers use and interact with. This role is also essential for the project because the software is able to be popular and successful if it is well-designed, attractive, simple and easy to use, quickly responsive. The software will be runned on three main platforms: iOS, Android and Windows which are very familiar with designers and users.
            <br><br>
            An AI Engineer is the spine of the project, they build, test and deploy AI models. This position will create machine learning based on implemented algorithms that analyze sets of data and learn from it. They are the ones who spend most time on testing, improving and training software to reach a higher level of accuracy. This role requires a wide span of knowledge in many fields such as deep learning, research, mathematics, Python, Java and etc.
