        <h1>Aims</h1>
        <p class="info">This project (Petcare) is about helping humans monitor their pet behaviours and health conditions for understanding and curing purposes with the use of technology. The system will be provided to veterinary clinics and hospitals worldwide to increase pet life qualities.</p>
        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p class="info">Petcare seeks to be delivered to many veterinary clinics and hospitals worldwide. We are willing to create an emotional connection between humans (owners) and their house animals so as to produce more experience to animal lovers and for people who want to do research on them.</p>
        <p class="info">The most important is accuracy of collecting data and information such as: blood pressure, heart rates, temperature, body languages and their behaviours then detect their emotions based on the situations. Therefore, pet owners will understand and know if their pets are happy, sad, angry or scared. Furthermore, veterinarians can observe pet health and reduce the range of diseases diagnosed.</p>
        <p class="info">Software has a main part totally based on AI which will be programmed by a software team who will include our current team member: Dung, Khoi and Huy. all members have to be experts at some aspects such as: data science, machine learning, linear algebra, implement algorithms and etc. Moreover, computer vision on cameras recording animal behaviours at houses.</p>
        <p class="info">Production plays an important role in our project, there are wearable kit (bell and animal body monitoring device) and camera with computer vision. Those hardware are available technologies at the current. Manufacturing will be an essential part for the success of Petcare to produce the kit, camera and licenses for the technologies, then there must be a technician team who will work on all the setup process for customers such as wearing bells, and equip cameras.</p>
        <h1>Roles</h1>
        <p class="info">
            Project Manager or Lead Developer who is compulsory to have in any project team will manage the tracking progress, timely delivery, divide workload, set up for meetings and make plans for goals and achievements.&nbsp;
            <br><br>
            The Data Engineer position plays an important role in the team. There is nothing when we start, so we need people who collect data and analyze them. To make machines learn, we definitely need a huge amount of data automatically absorbed and sorted. This position does algorithms to collect all the data such as: blood pressure, heart rate and behaviours of animals through sensors and cameras having computer vision. They will have many patterns for emotions, health conditions or habits.
            <br><br>
            User Interface Designer is the person who works on the front-end application view that customers use and interact with. This role is also essential for the project because the software is able to be popular and successful if it is well-designed, attractive, simple and easy to use, quickly responsive. The software will be runned on three main platforms: iOS, Android and Windows which are very familiar with designers and users.
            <br><br>
            An AI Engineer is the spine of the project, they build, test and deploy AI models. This position will create machine learning based on implemented algorithms that analyze sets of data and learn from it. They are the ones who spend most time on testing, improving and training software to reach a higher level of accuracy. This role requires a wide span of knowledge in many fields such as deep learning, research, mathematics, Python, Java and etc.
