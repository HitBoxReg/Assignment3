            About software, the project application will be launched in 4 platforms such as Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android with some requirements of version. For example, the project demands Windows 7 or higher for Windows, at least iOS 10.0, above macOS Sierra 10.12 and for Android version 7.0 or higher will be allowed, and the team will require licenses for the aforementioned dev kits. Furthermore, the software team will use Microsoft Azure AI Platform for multitasking such as Machine Learning, Vision Capabilities and Azure ML which is a Python-based service. We will use a product of a cloud computing giant - Google, the product which is Google Cloud AU Platform will be used to store data and create portable ML pipelines. Then about hardware, we will need computers or laptops which will reach requirements about graphic cards for every member in this team. Modern cameras with computer vision attached are demanded for testing and improving the program. Some simple materials such as bell traps for animals, green LED, sensors are essential.
        </p>
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p class="info">
            For the application, constant in-house testing of the features and of the AI is paramount. Hiring third-party QA agents is also up for consideration if the workload is too much for the in-house team. For the sensors, stress-testing for durability can be done by the hardware team, and the accuracy of the sensors can be tested on one of a team member&rsquo;s pet (Khoi&rsquo;s cat) with the help of a veterinarian.
        </p>
        <h1>Group Processes and Communication</h1>
        <p class = 'info'>Communication and communication skills have been an essential part in every group project, through it group members are able to deliver and receive information, ideas, changes, plans and updates for the project. In my group, we communicate face-to-face and online, we usually meet on RMIT campus after some lectures if we need to discuss something about the project, then we also make phone calls and have a group chat to discuss some minor issues daily. We have agreed that meetings take place twice a week and more if there is any emergency case. Normally, the meetings are held at RMIT campus after finishing lectures or tutorials and Facebook is the main platform that we believe to use for online communication and meetings. At first, our group will have a rule that members will be replaced if they are not active for three consecutive days without any acceptable reason and members have to tell the group if they have outside problems. We work on shared folders and documents such as Google Docs, Google Drive or Github, so that we can manage workload and processes of other members in the group. By that way, the new group members will have data, information and be able to continue on old members track if there is any disappeared teammate.</p>

            User experience designer which is usually called UX designer. Firstly, programming languages need to be mastered: HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery will help them remove transition between design handoff. User empathy plays an important role in success of the project because most customers do not care about software of the project, but they care about the output, the interface and how simple and easy to use the application. So that UX designers have to understand their problems, put themselves in users to know how they feel and have revolutionary changes. Moreover, visual communication is a must for UX designers because it has the most impact on users by interactive prototypes and vision.&nbsp;
