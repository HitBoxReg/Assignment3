            The application must go through QA to ensure functionality and a mostly-bug-free user experience, the application must also return its diagnosis results with an acceptable margin of error - if the symptoms and metrics the user has inputted or the application was able to collect from the sensors and the camera footage is not enough for the AI to return any diagnosis of at least a 50% possibility, then the user will be given a warning to consider the following results with absolute care. We are not required to give diagnosis that are 100% accurate, but only ><strong>a </strong><strong><em>list of most likely illnesses/diseases</em></strong>  and ><strong><em>how likely</em></strong>  (with the use of percentages) if possible, the rest is based on judgement from the medical professional using PetCare. The purpose is not to ><em> replace></em>  the physician, only to help them ><em> narrow down></em>  the cause for more timely and precise treatment. Diseases can share many common traits and symptoms, many of which slow down or hinder the correct diagnosis, what we strive to do is ><strong><em>shorten</em></strong>  the diagnosis process and ><strong><em>reduce</em></strong>  the probability of a miss-diagnosis as much as possible. > Because this is an AI project, a timeline estimate for our AI development is difficult to pinpoint - a machine learning project requires data for the training procedure, and the data quality highly determines the quality of the final solution, moreover, there is the ><em> no-free-lunch></em>  problem to overcome. Once the team is able to come up with a good model, they would then need to create the best dataset for training, the plethora of other AI systems in healthcare may help us in achieving both of these objectives.
            <br><br>
            Another important factor is accessibility, since PetCare is a service, we have to ensure there be as little down-time as possible, but not in cases without our control like outages that happen to our Cloud Service Provider, meaning on our end the application must stay live as long as the servers are running. The range of cover for our service is also important, but this unfortunately is dependent on our Cloud Service Provider of choice, of which there are many to choose from. We are not responsible for situations where the client loses internet connectivity and thus loses access to our services.
            <br><br>
            The application will be developed for the most common OS platform, most likely Windows 7 and above and OS X for the desktop, Android and IOS for the mobile version. We are not responsible for supporting any other OSes as it is highly unlikely that our target user base will use anything other than the aforementioned OSes.
            <br><br>
            The sensors must be accurate if applied to the correct measurement site (body part of the dog or cat). The sensor must remain functional for the duration of it being applied or worn on the animal and give accurate readings including: Heart beat, Blood pressure, HRV (heart rate variability). The design must be sturdy enough to withstand a reasonable level of blunt impact like being dropped from waist height, some level of water-resistance but not completely (like being spilled on but ><strong>NOT</strong> dropped into a pool).
            <br><br>
            The team of technicians sent for installation and training is not responsible for situations where the client platform (either desktops or mobile devices) is not supported by our application like outdated OSes (operating systems), not meeting minimum hardware requirements, or when the client is not within range of coverage for our services.

        <p class="info">
            About software, the project application will be launched in 4 platforms such as Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android with some requirements of version. For example, the project demands Windows 7 or higher for Windows, at least iOS 10.0, above macOS Sierra 10.12 and for Android version 7.0 or higher will be allowed, and the team will require licenses for the aforementioned dev kits. Furthermore, the software team will use Microsoft Azure AI Platform for multitasking such as Machine Learning, Vision Capabilities and Azure ML which is a Python-based service. We will use a product of a cloud computing giant - Google, the product which is Google Cloud AU Platform will be used to store data and create portable ML pipelines. Then about hardware, we will need computers or laptops which will reach requirements about graphic cards for every member in this team. Modern cameras with computer vision attached are demanded for testing and improving the program. Some simple materials such as bell traps for animals, green LED, sensors are essential.
        </p>
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p class="info">
            For the application, constant in-house testing of the features and of the AI is paramount. Hiring third-party QA agents is also up for consideration if the workload is too much for the in-house team. For the sensors, stress-testing for durability can be done by the hardware team, and the accuracy of the sensors can be tested on one of a team member&rsquo;s pet (Khoi&rsquo;s cat) with the help of a veterinarian.

            <p>Researching different ways an AI system can retrieve metrics for input (from cameras with footage recognition, audio from mics, text input, etc.) we stumbled on the <em>Stemoscope</em> product - an auditory sensor that is wearable by a baby or an animal to pick up heart beats, and decided to try making our own sensor (that can be sold separately or ran with the PetCare app)&nbsp;</p>

            <td>
            <p>We wanted a better, yet more accessible design for our sensors as opposed to <em>Stemoscope</em> (which uses self-patented audio sensors) and tried to think of popular products that can help monitor heart-related metrics like the Apple Watch which uses PPG (photoplethysmography). Upon further research into PPG technology we found that there was an abundance of vendors and products using this technology specifically for health monitoring and looked for ways this can be applied for dogs and cats. At first glance the veterinary scene has only been using PPG sensors for surgical operations, when the animal is put under anesthesia the sensor is placed on its tongue, which is not good for our purpose. We then found a research paper detailing alternative measurement sites (body part) that PPG sensors can be applied to dogs and cats, this was the breakthrough we were hoping for and thus decided to go into designing the sensor.</p>

        <h1>Group Processes and Communication</h1>
        <p class = 'info'>Communication and communication skills have been an essential part in every group project, through it group members are able to deliver and receive information, ideas, changes, plans and updates for the project. In my group, we communicate face-to-face and online, we usually meet on RMIT campus after some lectures if we need to discuss something about the project, then we also make phone calls and have a group chat to discuss some minor issues daily. We have agreed that meetings take place twice a week and more if there is any emergency case. Normally, the meetings are held at RMIT campus after finishing lectures or tutorials and Facebook is the main platform that we believe to use for online communication and meetings. At first, our group will have a rule that members will be replaced if they are not active for three consecutive days without any acceptable reason and members have to tell the group if they have outside problems. We work on shared folders and documents such as Google Docs, Google Drive or Github, so that we can manage workload and processes of other members in the group. By that way, the new group members will have data, information and be able to continue on old members track if there is any disappeared teammate.</p>
