        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <ul class="info">
            <li>Topic:</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="info">Our project, codenamed PetCare, is a subscription service that installs specialty equipment in veterinary clinics that make use of AI technology to help diagnose patients. The service will aid veterinarians in diagnosis, treatment, and the monitoring of 2 types of patient - Dogs and Cats.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="info">Not just in clinical environments, PetCare will also provide smart sensors that help pet owners monitor basic health metrics of their pets. These sensors will be made commercially available and come with the subscription package for clinics.</p>
        <ul class="info">
            <li>Motivation:</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="info">The biggest motivation for this project is to release some of the burdens medical professionals (specifically veterinarians) are constantly being put under because of the extremely high demand but very limited personnel in the field, whilst also improving animal Healthcare and Communication. This project will not only help vets but also their patients and pet owners - reducing the number of euthanizations; lower stress in clinical environments; push animal communication and behavioral science forward. The use of AI in communication is not an unfamiliar concept and has taken many great strides in making human communication as intuitive and effortless as possible, so why not apply this same technology to animal communication and further our understanding of all the species we share an ecosystem with? Being able to work on this project would prove the team&rsquo;s capability of working in many different fields and a passion for improving life with the use of technology.</p>
        <ul class="info">
            <li>Landscape:</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="info">There has not been any similar concept to PetCare that we know of, with only one similar product to our comercial sensor (Stemoscope) with which the main difference is our sensors will also make use of Photoplethysmography - the same technology Apple uses in apple watches to monitor heartbeat and blood pressure.</p>
