            <li class="title">Khoi's feedback:</li>
                <p>
                    Dung: The same as before, Dung is the only other member in the group that helps me work on the assignment in a dependable manner, we share most of the workload for both assignment 2 and 3 and communication between us is without issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Huy: Has managed to become even more irresponsible for this assignment, not showing up to meetings, asking for contribution only 4 days before the deadline (because of how unreliable Huy is considering his history, both me and Dung feel like assigning Huy ANYTHING to work on will work to the detriment of the team even if giving him something to do would lessen our workload) and he is not trustworthy enough for us to assign him anything because of how uncertain we are if he would ever finish his part or do it competently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anh: This member has disappeared since the start of the semester.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Khoi: Again, it is difficult for me to reflect on my own performance as the group only has 2 functioning members including myself. But the work we did between the two of us (Dung and I) was efficient and communication was pleasant.
                </p>
            <li class="title">Dung's feedback:</li>
                <p>
                    Khoi: He is the person that contributed the most in this report because we came up using his project idea, so he is a group leader. He has decided for many meetups and planned for the processes of this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Huy: we barely see him, although we have texted him every time we decided to have meetings, he always agreed but he has not shown up at all. Last time, when we had a meeting to divide workload and parts for Assignment 3 he did not come, so that the rest of his teammates decided to separate his parts because it is a group project requiring us to work as one and  there are many parts that we discuss and he did not know. Every time we tried to contact him, it took many hours, even days for him to respond and it was so difficult for us to collaborate.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Quang Anh: He has not contacted and responded to us since the first group project, so there is nothing to give feedback about him.
                </p>
            <li class="title"> Huy'd feedback:</li>
                <p>
                    We had given him a deadline for submitting his feedback and reflection (to which he did NOT meet) of saturday night, he sent the part to us around 9 pm Sunday (which the other 2 members of the group were not available to include into the website)
