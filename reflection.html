                    To me, the group as a whole only consists of Dung and I, for the workload we had it was tough for us to cover but we did our best and still managed to finish the most important parts of the assignment. I had doubts about being able to finish some of the parts of this assignment (like the websites) and one thing that went well was how quickly we were able to research different aspects of our assignment and came up with the correct adjustments. The most surprising thing is also how we managed to finish it with only 2 members.

                Most parts in this assignment were done by me and Khoi, Huy just did a few things, this happened because communicating with Huy got some troubles. To be clearer, it usually took him a long time to reply to my messages and he barely showed up to group meetings. So that we did not have a chance to show him or discuss with him about what this project is about or our plans and processes because the whole team has to work together on one idea and if he does not know anything, it would be a risky decision to work on this project. Moreover, it was four days until the deadline he texted me what to do and I assigned him to do his personal parts such as feedback, reflection or career plans and just pretend that he did some parts because it was too late and close to the due date.

            <li class="title">Huy:</li>
            <p>
                The same as feedback, Huy did not give us this part in a responsible or timely manner.
